## Hi there, I am Craig Simpkins PhD 👋

![Visitors](https://api.visitorbadge.io/api/visitors?path=csim063&countColor=%2344cc11)

Data scientist and ecologist based in Auckland, New Zealand. I work across research, government, consulting, and corporate, where I excel at solving complex data challenges, especially in environment and ecology, using advanced data analysis, machine learning, spatial statistics, and generative AI.

I also run [Emergent Data Analytics](https://emergentdata.co.nz), providing ecological modelling, geospatial analysis, and data science services for anyone who can benefit from them.

### 🛠️Key Skills

**Machine Learning & Predictive Modelling**
* End-to-end model development, from feature engineering to deployment and clear interpretation of results.

**Time-Series & Spatial Analysis**
* Specialising in complex, location-based and time-dependent data to uncover deeper, contextual insights that standard analyses miss.

**Cloud Data Architecture & Pipelines**
* Designing and implementing efficient, scalable, and reproducible data analysis workflows.

**Statistical Consulting & Research**
* Providing expert experimental design, rigorous statistical validation, and clear technical reporting for major initiatives.

### 🚀 Selected Projects

| Project | Description | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Te Kawau Tūmārō o Toi** | Co-authored the [baseline assessment](https://www.knowledgeauckland.org.nz/publications/the-forest-ecosystems-of-te-kawau-tumaro-o-toi-a-baseline-assessment-2025/) for a major multi-species eradication programme, synthesizing large-scale vegetation and bird community data. | `R`, `renv`, `Quarto`, `QGIS` |
| **Time-series modelling analysis** | Developed and benchmarked a suite of time-series models (from ARIMA to ML ensembles) to predict ecological outcomes using a messy public dataset, providing clear guidance on model selection under differing scenarios. | `R`, `Python`, `Scikit-learn`, `git` |
| **Spatial network design** | Designed a spatially-optimised sampling network for vegetation monitoring, using spatial statistics to maximise data quality while minimising operational costs. | `R`, `SQL`, `QGIS`, `git` |
| **Conservation prioritisation tool** | Developed a customised structured decision support tool for a local council to identify and rank areas with the highest priority for conservation investment. | `Python`, `SQL`, `ArcGIS`, `git` |
